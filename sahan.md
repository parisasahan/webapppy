# High-Level Architecture Description: E-commerce Data Storage on Azure

This document describes the high-level architecture for an e-commerce platform's data storage solution on Azure. It outlines the key components and their interactions in common scenarios, providing a conceptual basis for system design.

## 1. Key Architectural Components

The platform leverages a combination of specialized Azure services to handle diverse data needs:

1.  **Client (Web/Mobile App):** The primary interface for customer interaction (browsing, purchasing, account management).
2.  **Application Layer (APIs/Microservices):** Backend services that orchestrate business logic, data access, and integration between the client and various Azure storage/service components.
3.  **Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Caches and delivers static assets (images, videos, CSS, JavaScript) from edge locations close to users for fast load times.
4.  **Azure Cache for Redis:** An in-memory cache for frequently accessed data, user sessions, and short-lived data to improve performance and reduce database load.
5.  **Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C):** Manages customer identity and access (registration, sign-in, profile management, social logins).
6.  **Azure Cognitive Search:** Provides powerful and scalable search capabilities across the product catalog and potentially user reviews.
7.  **Azure SQL Database (or PostgreSQL/MySQL):** A relational database service for transactional data requiring strong consistency, primarily:
    *   **Order Management:** Stores order history, payment transactions, shipping details, and invoices.
    *   **Inventory Management:** Manages real-time stock levels with atomic operations.
8.  **Azure Cosmos DB:** A globally distributed, multi-model NoSQL database service for:
    *   **Product Catalog:** Stores detailed product information, specifications, variants, categories, pricing, and metadata for media.
    *   **Customer Profiles (Extended):** Stores additional user profile information, preferences, and personalization data not managed by Azure AD B2C.
    *   **Product Reviews & Ratings:** Manages user-generated content.
    *   **User Behavior Data:** Stores browsing history and interaction patterns for personalization.
    *   **(Optional) Active Shopping Carts:** Can be used for persistent shopping carts.
9.  **Azure Blob Storage:** Scalable and cost-effective storage for unstructured data:
    *   **Media Assets:** Stores product images, videos, and marketing banners.
    *   **Static Website Assets:** Original source for CSS, JavaScript files distributed via CDN.
    *   **Log Archival:** Long-term storage for telemetry and application logs.
    *   **(Optional) Data Lake:** Can be configured as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for raw data feeds for analytics.
10. **Azure Monitor:** Provides comprehensive monitoring across the application and infrastructure:
    *   **Application Insights:** For application performance monitoring (APM) and request tracing.
    *   **Log Analytics:** For collecting, querying, and analyzing logs from all services.
11. **Azure AI/ML Services (Conceptual):** Placeholder for services like Azure Machine Learning or Azure Personalizer, which would consume data from Cosmos DB or Blob Storage (ADLS Gen2) to provide features like product recommendations.

## 2. Interactions and Data Flows in Common E-commerce Scenarios

### a. User Browsing and Product Discovery
1.  **Client** requests product/category pages.
2.  Static assets (CSS, JS, marketing banners from **Blob Storage**) and product media (images/videos from **Blob Storage**) are served via **Azure CDN**.
3.  **Application Layer** fetches dynamic product details (specifications, pricing) from **Azure Cosmos DB (Product Catalog)**.
4.  For searches, the **Application Layer** queries **Azure Cognitive Search**. Results are used to fetch full details from **Cosmos DB**.
5.  Product reviews are fetched from **Azure Cosmos DB (Reviews)**.
6.  Stock availability is checked against **Azure Cache for Redis** (if cached) or **Azure SQL Database (Inventory)**.
7.  User session data (e.g., recently viewed items) is managed by the **Application Layer** using **Azure Cache for Redis**.

### b. User Authentication
1.  **Client** initiates sign-up/login, redirecting to **Azure AD B2C**.
2.  **Azure AD B2C** handles the authentication flow, issuing tokens upon success.
3.  **Client** sends tokens to the **Application Layer**, which validates them for resource access.
4.  The **Application Layer** retrieves extended profile data (preferences) from **Azure Cosmos DB (Customer Profiles)**.

### c. Order Placement and Processing
1.  Shopping cart data is managed by the **Application Layer**, potentially using **Azure Cache for Redis** for temporary carts or **Cosmos DB** for persistent carts.
2.  At checkout, the **Application Layer** processes the cart and, after payment confirmation (via an external gateway):
    *   Creates an order record in **Azure SQL Database (Orders)** with strong transactional consistency.
    *   Atomically updates stock levels in **Azure SQL Database (Inventory)**.
    *   May store generated invoices (e.g., PDFs) in **Azure Blob Storage**, linking them from the order record in SQL Database.

### d. User Session Management
1.  The **Application Layer** uses **Azure Cache for Redis** to store and retrieve session-specific data (e.g., temporary cart, UI state) for fast access during a user's active session.

### e. Personalization & Recommendations
1.  The **Application Layer** logs user browsing history and behavior to **Azure Cosmos DB (User Behavior)**. Raw clickstream data can also be directed to **Azure Blob Storage (ADLS Gen2)**.
2.  **Azure AI/ML Services** process this data to generate recommendations.
3.  The **Application Layer** fetches and displays these recommendations to the **Client**.

### f. Content Management (Admin Product Updates)
1.  Admins use an interface that interacts with the **Application Layer**.
2.  Product details are written to **Azure Cosmos DB (Product Catalog)**.
3.  Media files are uploaded to **Azure Blob Storage**.
4.  **Azure Cognitive Search** index is updated (e.g., via Cosmos DB change feed) to reflect catalog changes.

### g. Logging and Monitoring
1.  All Azure services and the **Application Layer** send logs and metrics to **Azure Monitor**.
2.  **Application Insights** tracks application performance and request flows.
3.  **Log Analytics** is used to query and analyze aggregated logs for operational insights and troubleshooting.
4.  Logs can be archived to **Azure Blob Storage** for long-term retention.

This architecture aims for scalability, resilience, and performance by leveraging appropriate Azure services for different data types and access patterns, forming a comprehensive data storage solution for a modern e-commerce platform.
